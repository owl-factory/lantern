# Alerts
Alerts are a non-intrusive means to deliver information to the user without needing a specific location on an individual page. Alerts operate on a queue system and are stacked on top of each other, displaying messages in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. 

## Dependencies
- MobX-Lite. Used to easily track the state of the components
- Chakra-UI

## TODOs
- [ ] Add a progress meter for timeout
