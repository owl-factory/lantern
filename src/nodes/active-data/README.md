# Active Data
The Active Data node is in charge of maintaining a single source of truth for actively used and edited documents. It stores partial copies of data from the Apollo.

## TODO
- [ ] Merge contents (specifically, how to handle changed positions?)
- [ ] Null handling of data; ensure that the field or content is deleted
