Brief: Avoid nulls; use undefined for values that do not exist
---
We should attempt to avoid `null` at all costs. If encountered, it should be made into an `undefined` instead with the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) so that we can have a consistent "undefined/null" value.

# Why
Javascript has two values of rough equivalence to null: `null` and `undefined`. While they have similar behavior, they are not identical. In particular, an object with a property equal to `null` does not cause an error when stringified and sent from the Next server to the client. On the contrary, an object with a property set as `undefined` does.

Because of these inconsistencies, we should use only one. We are using `undefined` as the functionality is better supported in Typescript. Optional parameters or properties, the result of the `Partial<T>` utility type, and so on.
