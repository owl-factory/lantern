# In-code Documentation

All top-level module `exports`, including functions, variables, and classes must be annotated with [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org) standard compliant comments Additionally, writing TSDocs for other non-exported or non-top-level code entities is encouraged for important or difficult to understand items. Reexports are excluded from these requirement but documenting them may still be useful. See TSDoc example below:

```typescript
/**
 * An example sum function for example jest testing.
 * @param numbers - set of rest parameters (...) accepted.
 * as an array of numbers to be summed together.
 * @returns sum of all numbers provided as parameters.
 */
export function sum(...numbers: number[]) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const number of numbers) {
    total += number;
  }
  return total;
}
```

Regular in-line comments should be used throughout the code when it's function may not be immediately clear or hacky solutions warrant justification. Example below:

```typescript
// Regex to test if sessionId is in the correct format:
// 40 characters that can only be a-Z, A-Z or 0-9.
return /^[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}$/.test(sessionId) ? sessionId : null;
```

Unfinished tasks in-code should be marked with uppercase TODO comments like so:

```typescript
// TODO finish this

/**
 * TODO finish this.
 */
```

Unfinished documentation in markdown should be uppercase and with a leading "#", no spaces, like so:

> #TODO Finish this doc.

TODO items must begin with an uppercase TODO for easy searchability (could be confused with a table called "todo", or other code items/comments).

**Note**: This doc is finished, the above TODO items are examples.
