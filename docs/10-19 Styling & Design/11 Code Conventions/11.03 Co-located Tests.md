Test files will be co-located with the files that they are testing. For example:

```
app/
	page.tsx
	page.spec.ts // Playwright test
utils/
	foo.ts
	foo.spec.ts // Jest unit test
```

This is true for Jest and Playwright tests.

We organize our tests in this way so that it is immediately visible if tests exist for a given file, both within the code and during the code review step.
