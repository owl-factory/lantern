By default, all folder, file, function, and variable names will be written in camelCase. For example, `namingConvention`. 

If in the case of an acronym, if the acronym must be used, it should be written as if it were a word. For example, in the case of some API variable name, we would use `namingConventionApi`.

If in the case of a component function or a class, the name will instead be in PascalCase. For example, `NamingConvention`. This is a requirement of React for components, and standard practice for classes. 

If in the case of a path within the App Router, the folder structure will instead use kebab-case. For example, `naming-convention`. This preserves the readability of the folder structure in the URL path. 

If in the case of a file-level variable whose value is constant and immutable, it should be in SCREAM_CASE. For example, `NAMING_CONVENTION`. For a clear example of what should be SCREAM_CASE, see the following:

```typescript
// Valid
const DEFAULT_CLASSES = "block";
const FOO_BAZ = {foo: "baz"};  // Does not change after here.

// Invalid! Use fooBaz instead. 
const FOO_BAZ = {};
FOO_BAZ.foo = "blah";

```
