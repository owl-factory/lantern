# REST API Conventions

All APIs will be location in the `app/api` directory. For example:

```
app/
	api/
	  ping/
      route.ts
```

REST APIs should be written using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) pattern, with different HTTP methods for each operation.

## Create

Create operations insert one or more new documents, objects, or rows into a database or cache. Use the HTTP `POST` method for create operations.

## Read

Read operations read any amount of data from a database, cache or filesystem. Reads may be complex queries or a static return of a value. Use the HTTP `GET` method for create operations.

## Update

Update operations update or replace one or more documents, objects, or rows in a database or cache. Use the HTTP `PATCH` method for partial updates that preserve the current data, and the `PUT` method for replacing data.

## Delete

Create operations remove one or more documents, objects, or rows from a database or cache. Use the HTTP `DELETE` method for delete operations.

**Note**: `POST` and `GET` may be used for other types of API requests that do not neatly match the pattern, such as the GraphQL and authentication endpoints.
