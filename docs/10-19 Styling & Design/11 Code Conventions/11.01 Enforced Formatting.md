We enforce consistent styling through the use of Prettier, the Prettier - Code formatter extension, and custom VSCode settings that apply the changes on save. 

Further, these requirements are enforced through ESLint, preventing the code from building if the linting is not met. 

This required formatting ensures that Lantern will have consistently formatted code, allowing the same difficulty in reading regardless of who or when the code was written.
