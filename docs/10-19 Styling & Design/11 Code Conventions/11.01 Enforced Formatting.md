We enforce consistent styling through the use of Prettier, the Prettier - Code formatter extension, and custom VSCode settings that apply the changes on save.

Further, these requirements are enforced through ESLint, preventing the code from building if the linting is not met.

Issue that can pop up is ESLint and Prettier's enforcement of Unix line endings, even on Windows. When working on Windows, you may need to disable git's autoclrf feature (automatic Windows line endings) to avoid getting a ton of errors. Use the command `git config --global core.autocrlf false` to do this.

This required formatting ensures that Lantern will have consistently formatted code, allowing the same difficulty in reading regardless of who or when the code was written.
