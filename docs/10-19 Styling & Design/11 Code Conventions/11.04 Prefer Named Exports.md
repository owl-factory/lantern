Brief: Prefer using named exports instead of the default export
---
We should prefer named exports to default exports in almost all cases. The sole exception to this is when a default export is required for a programmatic reason, such as the component function of a `page.tsx` file in the App Router. 

# Why
While default exports seem nice, they can obfuscate what is actually being called. Additionally, if refactoring, automatic tools to rename the exports will not work with default exports.
