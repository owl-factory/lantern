Brief: Defines the code structure
---
The code structure within the `src/` directory will roughly be the following:

```
app/
components/
context/
data/ 
features/
layouts/
lib/
hooks/
services/
types/
utils/
```

`app` - the NextJS App router directory, replacing pages.

`components` - general use components. 

`context` - React context used within the app

`data` - Any hardcoded data and configuration.

`features` - A folder containing a folder per feature, each with a mirror of the root-level layout, and with members made public with an `index.ts` file at a feature's root. 

`layouts` - Components such as headers, footers, and other layout-affecting things. 

`lib` - wrappers around external libraries to allow for easily updating them between their versions and providing some additional middleware. 

`hooks` - Any custom React hooks

`services` - calls to APIs, be they internal or external

`types` - the types used within the project

`utils` - Small, pure functions that do a simple, easily testable thing.
