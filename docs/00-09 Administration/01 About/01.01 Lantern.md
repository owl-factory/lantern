Brief: A summary of Lantern and its goals.
---
**Lantern** is a web project aimed to create a flexible, open-source alternative to online tabletop RPG services such as Roll20 and D&D Beyond.

Currently, it is built using Typescript, React, NextJS, and GraphQL, supported with a backing of a Postgres database. 

# Why?
Roll20 has been a grating experience to use, with many problems that seem like they shouldn't be problems to begin with. 

Further, by creating an extensible and open-source system, we can give users a system that *they* want to use, rather than a system constantly changing and mangled by the need to grow.
