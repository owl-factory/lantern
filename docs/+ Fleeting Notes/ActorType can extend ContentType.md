An ActorType should be able to extend a ContentType. For example, an Item ContentType, used for building out a character's inventory with Sword and Breastplate Content, can be extended by an Item ActorType in the form of, say, a Bag of Holding. This Item ActorType would have all fields as defined by the ContentType, but additionally be able to have a changeable storage itself. 

Further, functionality for this can be implemented such that a character (Waals) can have a Bag of Holding. When I click on the Bag of Holding in Waals' character sheet, it can open up the Bag of Holding's character sheet, allowing access to its inventory. 

This would play well with our intended ideas of drag and drop inventory from one Actor to another. 

Another idea that can come as a result of this is "shadowed" inventory. If I loot a spellbook from an enemy, then those spells can appear within my character sheet; they would be linked as belonging to the original actor, but visible without needing to go into submenus or a different actor's sheet.

Laura writes this down because she had the idea the night before to have sub-inventories within a Character, in the form of the Dungeoneering or Artisan Tools seen in starting loadouts, backpacks that can be set down or lost, Bags of Holding, and Spellbooks.
