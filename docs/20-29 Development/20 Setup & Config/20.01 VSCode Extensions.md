# Linting and Formatting
## ESLint
[Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

The **ESLint** extension provides visualization of linting errors within the code, allowing for seeing them when they occur rather than having to hunt them down when running the `lint` command.

## Prettier - Code formatter
[Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

The **Prettier - Code formatter** extension is used for automatically formatting your code in accordance with the configuration set with `.prettierrc`. 

With the settings set within `.vscode/settings.json`, this will automatically format your code on save to be consistent with our Prettier configurations. 

# Testing
## Jest
[Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest)

The **Jest** extension allows for automatically running Jest tests when code is changed, ensuring that you know when a test fails right when it happens, instead of needing to run the `pnpm run test:unit` command. 

The included VSCode `settings.json` should configure Jest to run with the appropriate command.
