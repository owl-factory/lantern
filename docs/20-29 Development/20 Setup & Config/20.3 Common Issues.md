# Common Issues

## TypeError: can't access property "call"

This issue is caused by service workers running while Next is in development mode. To fix:

- Shut down Next development server.
- Delete the files `public/sw.js` and `public/swe-worker*.js`.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` and open the browser's `Developer Tools -> Application -> Service workers` tab and unregister all service workers on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Restart the dev server and reload the page.
